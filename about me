    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, I'm ThePoff, formerly known as Poff1327. Due to security reasons, I've rebranded myself as ThePoff. I'm 14 years old and passionate about creating content online.</p>
    <p>I enjoy spending time with friends and creating videos. Whether it's vlogs, gaming content, or tutorials, I love expressing myself through video.</p>
    <p>Currently, I'm in the 9th grade at Luice Luimier School in Morocco. While I'm not thrilled about my school, I'm dedicated to learning and growing.</p>
    <p>I have a knack for athletics, particularly running and jumping. I also practice boxing and enjoy the physical and mental challenges it brings.</p>
    <p>To get a better sense of who I am and what I do, feel free to check out my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thepoff1327" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
    <p>Thanks for taking the time to learn a bit about me. I'm excited to continue sharing my journey and connecting with others through my content.</p>
